# Core Conventions

## Code Quality

- Write clear, readable code over clever code
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY), but avoid premature abstraction

## Comments & Documentation

- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- Use docstrings for public APIs
- Keep documentation up to date

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly
- Provide helpful error messages
- Fail fast on invalid inputs

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

## Git

- Commit messages: imperative mood
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Never commit secrets or credentials

## Performance

- Optimize only when necessary
- Profile before optimizing
- Prefer readability over micro-optimizations
